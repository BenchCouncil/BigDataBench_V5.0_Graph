How to use:

Spark Version Requirement: 1.4.0 or more
1. Generate data by using the script in the dir of ../DataGenerator
2. Set the parameters in the run_graph.sh, such as SPARK_HOME, INPUT_PATH, OUTPUT_PATH (the full path of hdfs, e.g. hdfs://localhost:9000/path)
3. Set the parameters for algorithms you wanna to run, which are in the run_graph.sh, each if bound
4. Run the run_graph.sh, select the algorithm you wanna to run

Notes:
You may get the error like "java.io.FileNotFoundException: hdfs:/hw005:9000/spark-graph-out/cc_1449716066214_runTime", but it seems no effect on the real running of the benchmarks
